# Challenge03PWGen
## Description

This is a project where started code was supplied and we were to write a function to generate a random password. The generator itself presents a series of prompts which ask the user which criteria they would like to use when generating. These include a length of minimum 8 characters to maximum 128 characters, the use of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or both, the use of symbols, and the use of numbers. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Please generate a random password! Note that if you enter numbers outside of 1-128 or other words when it first asks for your password length you will be asked to enter a number between 1-128. Otherwise there are multiple ways to customize your password. Here is a screenshot of the generator's final product: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123116188/218344928-54b72a7e-b8b4-4c8c-9ba2-3a52332eadf9.png)
